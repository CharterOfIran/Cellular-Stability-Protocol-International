# 🤝 Secure & Anonymous Contribution Guide

We welcome all expertise, ideas, and critiques to refine this Charter. The security of our volunteers and the sustainability of this project are our absolute red lines. Before starting any activity, please read this guide carefully.

### 1. 🛡️ Identity Security (Absolute Priority)
* **Pseudonymous Accounts:** We strictly recommend participating using anonymous accounts. If you do not have a secure account, please refer to our **[Guide to Setting Up an Anonymous GitHub Account](Help/Security/anonymous-github-setup.md)**.
* **Access Tools:** Always log in via the **Tor Browser** or VPN/Proxy tools that ensure no DNS leaks.
* **Personal Information:** Avoid sharing your real name, phone number, personal catchphrases, or any digital footprint that could lead to your identification.

### 2. 🛠️ How to Contribute (Operational Methods)
* **Check Current Tasks:** To view priorities and open collaboration roles, visit our **[Task List](./Collaboration-Desk/Task-List.md)**.
* **Submit Proposals or Critiques:** If you find a flaw in the protocols, use the [Issues](../../issues/new/choose) section and select the **"💡 Protocol Proposal or Critique"** template.
* **Submit Revisions (Pull Requests):** If you have rewritten a text, submit it via a PR. The security team will audit the file before merging.

### 3. 🎨 Submitting Graphical Files
Due to security concerns, avoid direct image uploads to GitHub. For instructions on the secure submission method for designs, read the **[Design Desk Protocol](./Collaboration-Desk/tasks/01-infographic-design/README.md)**.

### 4. ⚖️ Data Governance
All technical activities in this project must strictly comply with our **[Identity and Data Protection Protocol](Help/Security/identity-protection.md)**.

*Our strength lies in our organization and our collective security.*

# 🛡️ Public Asset and Document Protection Protocol

This document is designed to prevent the looting of national wealth, the destruction of banks, and the loss of citizens' property records during the first 72 hours of transition.

## 1. Protection of Banks and Treasuries
* **Physical Closure:** All bank branches must be closed immediately, and their entrances sealed by local volunteers and trusted staff.
* **Freeze on Liquidity Outflow:** The withdrawal of large cash sums, gold, or jewelry from bank vaults is strictly prohibited until the establishment of the interim government.
* **ATM Protection:** Volunteers must prevent the destruction of ATMs; these machines are essential for the limited distribution of liquidity in the second phase.

## 2. Safeguarding Records (Registry Offices and Judiciary)
* **Sealing Archives:** Archive rooms containing land titles, housing deeds, and citizens' judicial records must be physically sealed in the presence of guild representatives and the Neighborhood Council.
* **Data Servers:** IT technicians are tasked with cutting remote access to national databases and physically isolating servers to prevent the intentional deletion of records.

## 3. Protection of Museums and Cultural Centers
* These centers are our historical wealth. The Neighborhood Council is responsible for deploying teams of trusted volunteers for **unarmed guarding** around museums to prevent the smuggling of antiquities.

## 4. Prohibition of Forced Occupation
* Any occupation of government buildings or private properties during these 72 hours is illegal and will be prosecuted as a civil crime in transition-period courts.

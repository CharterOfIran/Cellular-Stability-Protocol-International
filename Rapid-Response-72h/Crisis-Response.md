# 🔄 Operational Crisis Protocol: The First 72 Hours Roadmap

This document does not represent a central command but acts as a coordinator for independent neighborhood cells. Goal: Transforming "initial shock" into "civic stability" over 3 decisive days.

## 🏁 General Strategy: "From House to Neighborhood, From Neighborhood to City"

### Phase 1: First 24 Hours (Cellular Stabilization)
Focus on preventing panic and securing basic needs.
* **Output:** Formation of the neighborhood watch core and identifying operational bakeries/clinics.

### Phase 2: 24 to 48 Hours (Communication & Logistics)
Focus on networking.
1. **Mesh Network Activation:** Connecting neighborhood houses according to the **[Mesh Protocol](../Infrastructure/Mesh-Networks.md)**.
2. **Resource Exchange:** Neighborhood liaisons should exchange goods or information with adjacent neighborhoods via the **[Coordination Chain](./Coordination-Chain.md)**.
3. **Friction Prevention:** Implementing **[Interim Justice](./Interim-Justice.md)** protocols to avoid internal conflicts over resources.

### Phase 3: 48 to 72 Hours (Civic Organization)
The neighborhood transforms into a temporary administrative unit:
1. **Council Consolidation:** Finalizing a 5-to-9 member board to manage energy and fuel distribution.
2. **Asset Protection:** Sealing and guarding local banks and government offices to prevent looting or document destruction.
3. **Potential Assessment:** Identifying fuel reserves and prioritizing them for ambulances and vital generators.

## ⚠️ Operational Red Lines
* **Media Silence:** Only trust verified news from the radio or local Mesh networks.
* **Avoid Main Street Gatherings:** Large, unorganized crowds are easy targets for violence. Our strength lies in "neighborhood-based decentralization."
* **No Arbitrary Violence:** Any confrontation with agents of the previous structure must follow the justice protocol.

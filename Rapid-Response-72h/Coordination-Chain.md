# 🔗 Decentralized Coordination Chain

This document serves as the protocol for connecting "Independent Cells" to one another. In the absence of central management, coordination is achieved not through top-down commands, but through the **Exchange of Needs and Capabilities.**

## 1. Structure of Coordination Nodes
Every operational group within the neighborhood must designate a "Coordination Liaison":
* **Sector Liaison:** Coordinates with bakers and shops according to [Sectors-Duty.md](./Sectors-Duty.md).
* **Security Liaison:** Coordinates with watch teams according to [Neighborhood-Watch.md](../Civil-Safety/Neighborhood-Watch.md).
* **Technical Liaison:** Coordinates with power and network specialists according to [Mesh-Networks.md](../Infrastructure/Mesh-Networks.md).
* **Health Liaison:** Coordinates with the emergency aid station according to [Emergency-Health.md](../Civil-Safety/Emergency-Health.md).

## 2. Messaging Protocol on Mesh Networks
To prevent clogging the local network bandwidth, messages must be sent using the following format:
`[Sender Group] -> [Receiver Group] : [Urgency: 1 to 3] : [Short Message]`

* **Example:** `Health -> Tech : 1 : Insulin section generator failed. Need immediate help.`
* **Urgency Levels:**
    1.  **Priority 1 (Critical):** Life-threatening risk or loss of key infrastructure.
    2.  **Priority 2 (Essential):** Depletion of food or medical resources within the next 6 hours.
    3.  **Priority 3 (Routine):** Status reports and shift changes.

## 3. Conflict Resolution Mechanism
If two groups disagree over a shared resource (e.g., generator fuel):
1.  **Alignment with Roadmap:** Priority is given to the phases defined in [Crisis-Response.md](./Crisis-Response.md).
2.  **Elder/Trustee Arbitration:** Three members of the [Neighborhood Council](../Civil-Safety/Neighborhood-Coordination.md) who are not stakeholders in the issue will make the final decision based on "Collective Survival."

## 4. Horizontal Neighborhood Connection (Inter-Neighborhood)
To prevent the isolation of neighborhoods:
* **Neighbor Liaison:** The Neighborhood Council appoints one person to exchange information with the adjacent neighborhood once daily (physically or via radio/mesh, if possible).
* **Surplus Sharing:** If one neighborhood has a surplus of bread and the adjacent neighborhood has a surplus of medicine, this exchange must be conducted with the approval of both Councils.

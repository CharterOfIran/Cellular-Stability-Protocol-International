# ⚖️ Transitional Justice and Violence Prevention Protocol (Interim Draft)

The objective of this document is to establish legal order during the first 72 hours of the transition period and to prevent "vigilante justice" or arbitrary acts of revenge. We firmly believe that the path to freedom must not be tainted by extrajudicial bloodshed.

## 1. The Principle of Prohibiting Personal Revenge
* No individual or group has the right to arbitrarily detain, torture, or execute anyone (including officials or affiliates of the former regime) under the pretext of past crimes.
* All suspects must be held for trial in the "Competent Courts of the Transition Period." Any unauthorized physical confrontation will be considered a criminal act and subject to future prosecution.

## 2. Secure Preventive Detention
* In cases where individuals are identified as imminent threats to public safety or vital infrastructure, they may be detained by neighborhood volunteer teams (according to the **[Neighborhood Council Guide](../Civil-Safety/Neighborhood-Coordination.md)**) until the formal establishment of judicial authorities.
* **Human Rights Standards:** Strict adherence to the humane treatment of detainees is mandatory. This includes the provision of adequate food, water, and medical care, as well as the absolute prohibition of any form of physical or psychological abuse.

## 3. Preservation of Evidence and Documentation
* To ensure the realization of true justice in the future, all eyewitnesses and victims are encouraged to systematically collect and preserve their documentation (including photographs, videos, and physical records).
* **Protection of Archives:** Citizens must strictly avoid destroying documents or burning archives in security, intelligence, or judicial centers. These records are the primary keys to holding fair and transparent trials in the future.

## 4. Neighborhood-Based Mediation
* In the event of local disputes or flare-ups over historical grievances, the "Legal Task Force" of the Neighborhood Council is mandated to intervene as a mediator.
* The primary goal of this mediation is to de-escalate the situation and defer the final resolution of the dispute to a period of national stability.

## 5. Public Safety and Looting Prevention
* Any unauthorized occupation of government buildings, public spaces, or private property during these 72 hours is strictly prohibited and will be documented as a civil crime.

# 🕒 Hours 1 to 6: Reconnection and Cellular Securing

This phase is the most critical window for transforming public panic into **"Neighborhood-Based Order."** The primary focus is on the family unit and the immediate neighbor-to-neighbor core.

## 1. Reconnection Phase (Hours 1 to 2) - "Locate Each Other Without Mobile Service"
* **Meeting Point:** Immediate return of all family members to a pre-designated location. Assume a total cellular network shutdown.
* **Analog Messaging System:** If you must leave your location, leave a paper note containing (Date, Time, Destination, and Health Status) in a "Secret Safe Spot" (e.g., under a specific planter or a pre-agreed wall crevice).
* **Digital Discipline:** Avoid repetitive unanswered calls to conserve phone battery for life-critical emergencies.

## 2. Home Stabilization and Logistics (Hours 2 to 4) - "Turn Home into a Shelter"
* **Water Storage:** Immediately fill bathtubs, large pots, and bottles. In a crisis, municipal water pressure is often the first infrastructure to fail.
* **Infrastructure Security:** Shut off the main gas valve if not needed. Bring communication devices (Power banks, Radios) to a full charge.
* **Liquidity and Fuel:** In these early hours, priority lies in having physical cash and a half-full fuel tank; banking networks and gas stations are primary targets for disruption.

## 3. Neighborhood Connection (Hours 4 to 6) - "Every Alley, One Headquarters"
* **Visual Contact:** Establish contact with at least two trusted neighbors. Your security is intrinsically linked to your neighbor's security.
* **Radio as the Sole Reference:** Use FM/AM radio for news updates. Do not rely on social media rumors (even if limited access is available).
* **Silence Protocol:** Avoid entering "blind traffic" on main roads. Remain in the neighborhood and monitor the entry points of your complex or alley.

# 🕒 Phase 1: Operational Protocol for the First 24 Hours

The first 24 hours are the critical window for **"Transitioning from Shock to Organization."** During this period, the primary objective is to form initial neighborhood cells and prevent tragic incidents caused by collective panic.

## 🕒 Operational Timeline:

1. **[Hours 1 to 6: Joining and Securing](./01-Immediate-Action.md)**
   * **Focus:** Family reunification, neighbor identification, and establishing primary security.
2. **[Hours 6 to 12: Assessment and Capacity Mapping](./02-Neighborhood-Assessment.md)**
   * **Focus:** Identifying local bakeries, physicians, and water/fuel reserves.
3. **[Hours 12 to 18: Sustainability and Cohesion](./03-Sustainability-Cohesion.md)**
   * **Focus:** Initiating bread production, medical distribution, and psychological management of the neighborhood.
4. **[Hours 18 to 24: Cellular Consolidation and Dawn Readiness](./04-Consolidation-NextDay.md)**
   * **Focus:** Establishing night-watch shifts and planning for the second day.

## ⚠️ General Instruction
Do not act alone in any of these stages. The strength of this protocol lies in **Collective and Neighborhood-Based Action.**

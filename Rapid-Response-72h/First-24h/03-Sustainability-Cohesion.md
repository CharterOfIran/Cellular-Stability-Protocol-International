# 🕒 Hours 12 to 18: Sustainability Management and Cellular Cohesion

During this window, physical exhaustion and psychological pressure reach their peak. The objective of this phase is to maintain biological sustainability (food and hygiene) and to prevent moral collapse at the neighborhood level.

## 1. Food and Energy Management (Hours 12 to 14) - "Smart Shared Resources"
* **Consumption Priority:** Consume perishable food items from refrigerators first (assuming a power outage). Avoid repeatedly opening freezer doors to preserve the cold for sensitive items like insulin.
* **Safe Cooking:** If the gas supply is cut, use portable stoves or grills in outdoor spaces (while adhering to the **Darkness Protocol**). Strictly avoid using open flames inside apartments due to the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning or fire.

## 2. Hygiene and Waste Protocol (Hours 14 to 16) - "Epidemic Prevention"
* **Sanitation Management:** If water pumps are non-functional, do not use toilet flushes. Place heavy-duty trash bags inside toilet bowls; after use, seal them tightly with knots and disinfectants (chlorine or alcohol) and collect them in a designated area away from living quarters.
* **Grey Water Storage:** Save "grey water" (water used for washing hands or dishes) for emergency cleaning purposes.

## 3. Neighborhood Peace and Crisis Psychology (Hours 16 to 18) - "Distributing Calm"
* **Medicine Sharing:** If a neighbor has run out of life-critical medication (e.g., for blood pressure or epilepsy), the neighborhood cell is responsible for redistributing available supplies. The health collapse of one neighbor endangers the security of the entire alley.
* **Anger Control:** Filter out rumors and unverified news from unofficial sources. Local trustees must actively engage with distressed individuals to prevent "Impulsive Behaviors" (such as unnecessarily leaving the secured neighborhood).

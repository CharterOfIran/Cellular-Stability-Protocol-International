# 🕒 Hours 6 to 12: Neighborhood Assessment and Stabilization

After navigating the initial shock and securing the family unit, the focus shifts from the **"Home"** to the **"Alley and Apartment Complex."** The objective of this phase is to prevent the infiltration of insecurity and to establish a local sustainability network.

## 1. Light and Sound Discipline (Hours 6 to 8) - "The Darkness Protocol"
* **Visual Blackout:** In the event of power outages or high-risk conditions, use thick curtains or cardboard to prevent light leakage. From an external or aerial perspective, the neighborhood should appear dark and uninhabited to avoid attracting unwanted attention.
* **Acoustic Control:** Keep the volume of radios and conversations to a minimum. This ensures "Audio Situational Awareness" of the external environment (detecting footsteps, vehicles, or suspicious movements).

## 2. Formation of the Initial Neighborhood Core (Hours 8 to 10) - "Human Capital Assessment"
* **Skill Identification:** Discreetly and friendly identify neighbors with technical skills (electricians, plumbers), medical expertise (doctors, nurses), or high physical stamina.
* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify households with elderly residents, infants, or patients with special needs (e.g., those requiring oxygen or insulin). Cellular security means ensuring no link in the chain breaks due to hunger or illness.

## 3. Monitoring and Watch (Hours 10 to 12) - "Soft Security"
* **Establishing Watch Shifts:** In coordination with neighbors, set up 2-hour shifts to monitor alley entrances or rooftops. The goal is **not "confrontation"** but **"Early Warning and Information."**
* **Simple Alert System:** Agree on a specific sound (e.g., rhythmic knocking on metal railings or a unique whistle) to alert neighbors in case of unauthorized entry by strangers.

# 🕒 Phase 0: Proactive Readiness (Pre-Zero Hour)

This folder contains the actions you must take **today**—while the internet is still accessible and urban order remains intact. Preparation at this stage increases your success rate during the critical 72-hour window by 100%.

## 📂 Documents in this Phase:
* **[Zero-Hour Checklist (00-Pre-Zero-Hour.md)](./00-Pre-Zero-Hour.md):** A comprehensive list for shopping, digital preparations, and family agreements.

## 🎯 Why is this Phase Critical?
Many of our tools (such as offline applications, satellite maps, or communication protocols) require downloading and initial setup. Once the internet is disconnected, accessing this knowledge and these tools will become impossible.

**First Step:** Print these files now or save them for offline access on multiple devices.

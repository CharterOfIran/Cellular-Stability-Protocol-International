# 🕒 Zero-Hour Readiness Checklist (Actionable Today)

This document is the most vital part of your preparation. The actions you take at this stage will determine whether you operate with **Mastery** or **Panic** during the first hour of a crisis (the moment of internet shutdown or infrastructure disruption).

## 1. Information Readiness (The Printing Protocol)
At "Zero Hour," mobile phones are unreliable due to tracking risks, battery depletion, or network blackouts.
* **Physical Copies:** Print all files in the `Rapid-Response-72h` folder (especially the First 24-Hour protocols) today. Keep them in a waterproof folder in an accessible location.
* **Hardcopy Maps:** Obtain a printed map of your neighborhood and mark alternative routes to local medical centers.
* **Digital Fortification:** Install offline communication apps (**Briar** or **Bridgefy**) on all family members' phones and test them once in offline mode (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).

## 2. Logistic Readiness (Survival and Sustainability)
* **FM/AM Radio:** The only communication tool whose signal remains resilient during infrastructure collapse. Procure a battery-powered radio with extra batteries.
* **Small-Denomination Cash:** POS terminals are the first victims of a blackout. Always keep a supply of physical cash in small bills for emergency purchases like bread or medicine.
* **Fuel Reserves:** Cultivate the habit of never letting your vehicle or motorcycle fuel tank drop below 50%.
* **Biological Supply:** Store at least 20 liters of water per person and a minimum 2-week supply of life-critical medications (e.g., insulin, blood pressure, or heart medication).

## 3. Human Agreements (The Security Network)
* **Family Rendezvous Point:** Agree with family members on a specific "Meeting Point" (home or a distinct address) and a specific time to gather if the mobile network fails unexpectedly.
* **Identifying Two Neighbors:** Start a conversation with at least two trusted neighbors today. Your security is fundamentally linked to the stability of your block or alley.
* **Role Review:** If you are a physician, baker, or technician, review the **[Sectors-Duty.md](../Sectors-Duty.md)** file to understand your role in the first hour.

## 4. The 72-Hour Survival Kit
Prepare a backpack containing the essentials listed in the **[Emergency-Kit.md](../Emergency-Kit.md)** and place it where it can be grabbed in less than 30 seconds.

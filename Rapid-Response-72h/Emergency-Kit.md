# 🎒 Emergency Toolkit (Physical & Psychological)

## Part I: Physical Essentials (Go-Bag)
Prepare a durable backpack containing:
1. **Documents & Cash:** Copies of IDs/deeds in waterproof folders; small-denomination cash; essential phone numbers on paper.
2. **Nutrition & Survival:** 3L of water per person; non-perishable food (canned, nuts); flashlight with extra batteries; charged power bank.
3. **Health:** First-aid kit; 1 week of personal medications; hygiene products.

## Part II: Crisis Psychology (Mental Toolbox)
In the first 72 hours, "panic" is the greatest enemy.

### 1. Managing Personal Panic (The 5-4-3-2-1 Technique)
If you feel overwhelmed, focus on your surroundings:
* Name **5** things you see.
* **4** things you can touch.
* **3** sounds you hear.
* **2** smells you perceive.
* **1** taste in your mouth.
This shifts your brain from "panic mode" to "analytical mode."

### 2. Dealing with Distressed Individuals
* **Establish Eye Contact:** Speak in a calm, firm tone.
* **Assign a Task:** Give them a small physical job (e.g., "Please hold this water bottle"). Physical action restores focus.

# ⚡ Rapid Response Package (72-Hour Transition)

This folder is the most critical part of the project; a collection of operational protocols for neighborhood management, infrastructure preservation, and violence prevention during the **first 72 hours** of the transition period. The goal is to transform "public panic" into "neighborhood-based civic order."

## 🎯 Strategic Objectives
1. **Biological Resilience:** Ensuring the sustainability of food (bakeries), medicine, and water at the local level.
2. **Stable Communication:** Activating local Mesh networks in the event of a global internet shutdown.
3. **Civic Security:** Protecting citizens' lives and safeguarding national documents and public assets.
4. **Justice and Law:** Preventing personal vendettas and establishing temporary legal order.

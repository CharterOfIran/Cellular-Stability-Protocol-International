# 🚨 30 Seconds to Safety: Rapid Response Protocol for Aerial Strikes

> **ATTENTION:** Internalize this protocol now. When an explosion occurs, there is no time to read. The objective is to transform these actions into a **Conditioned Reflex**.

---

## 1. Immediate Threat Mitigation (Action: Now!)
* **Clear the Windows:** The primary cause of urban casualties is high-velocity glass shards propelled by the **Blast Wave**. Move away from all glass surfaces immediately.
* **Propped Internal Doors:** Keep interior doors (rooms, bathrooms) open. This allows the **Overpressure Wave** to pass through the structure, preventing door frames from deforming and trapping you inside.
* **Footwear Necessity:** If accessible, put on sturdy shoes immediately. Navigating a post-impact environment covered in shattered glass is impossible barefoot.

## 2. Designated Home Shelter (Where to Anchor?)
Identify your safest "Stability Node" based on your building's architecture:

* **Modern Structures (Steel or Reinforced Concrete Frame):**
    * Move toward the **Stairwell Landing** (do NOT use elevators) or position yourself against **Main Load-Bearing Columns** at the center of the unit.
    * Prioritize internal walls that have no contact with the building's exterior.
* **Older Structures (Unreinforced Masonry/Brick):**
    * Take cover under a **Heavy-Duty Dining Table** or a reinforced interior door frame.
    * Maintain maximum distance from "Peripheral Walls" (walls with windows or facing the street).
* **Universal Rule:** Wall corners (Interior Angles) provide significantly more structural integrity than the center of a room.

## 3. Defensive Posture (Protecting Vital Organs)
If you cannot reach a designated shelter, drop to the ground immediately and adopt the following posture:

1.  **Prone Position:** Lie face down on the belly. Place your hands over or under your head.
2.  **Chest Elevation:** Use your elbows to lift your chest slightly (a few centimeters) off the floor. This prevents the **Ground Shockwave** from causing internal hemorrhaging or lung collapse.
3.  **Pressure Equalization:** Keep your mouth slightly open to equalize air pressure on both sides of the eardrums, preventing rupture.
4.  **Ocular Protection:** Keep your eyes tightly shut.

## 4. Post-Impact Awareness (The Second Wave)
* **Hold Position:** Do not move for at least 120 seconds. Secondary strikes or falling structural debris often follow the initial impact.

# 🚀 Air-Raid & Missile Strike Protocols (Civilian Survival)

This directory contains critical survival instructions for aerial bombardments and missile strikes.

⚠️ **URGENT:** Field data indicates that in many modern strikes, sirens may not precede the impact. Often, the first warning is the **"Sound of Explosion."** At that moment, the brain lacks the window for logical analysis.

### 🧠 Tactical Strategy: "Instinctive Response" (Muscle Memory)
Our approach in this module is not for "in-the-moment" reading. The objective is for you to study and rehearse the **[Quick Action Guide](./00-QUICK-ACTION.md)** today (during calm) until it becomes an **automatic, instinctive reaction**.

## 📂 Content Structure (Phase-Based Actions)

### 1. Pre-Event Readiness (Proactive Rehearsal - Start Today)
* **[Home Shielding](./Home-Shielding.md):** Hardening your residence into a more resilient space against pressure waves and shrapnel.
* **[🚨 30-Second Quick Action Guide](./00-QUICK-ACTION.md):** **Read this multiple times.** You must know exactly which corner of your home to reach and what posture to take without a second thought.

### 2. During the Event (Impact Moment)
* In this moment, rely strictly on your prior drills. If panic sets in, use this file for a rapid visual reminder: **[Emergency Reaction](./00-QUICK-ACTION.md)**.

### 3. Recovery Phase (Post-Impact)
* **[Post-Attack Protocols](./After-Attack.md):** Safety measures for building evacuation and managing secondary hazards like gas leaks or fires.

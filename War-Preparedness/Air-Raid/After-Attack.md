# 🛠️ Post-Impact Protocols: Recovery & Emergency Relief

This guide is designed for the critical minutes and hours following the cessation of sirens or explosions. The objective: **Mitigating secondary hazards and organizing decentralized local relief.**

## 1. Exiting the Shelter (Patience & Vigilance)
* **The 120-Second Rule:** Do not relocate immediately after an impact. Secondary strikes or delayed structural collapses are common. Wait at least 2 minutes.
* **Self-Triage & Assessment:** Check yourself and those around you for injuries. Due to high adrenaline levels, severe wounds or internal trauma may not be felt initially.
* **Footwear Protocol:** Ensure you are wearing heavy-duty footwear before moving. Glass shards and structural debris are the primary hazards post-impact.

## 2. Infrastructure Safety Audit (Critical)
* **Gas Leak Mitigation:** **DO NOT** use matches, lighters, or electrical switches. If you smell gas or hear a hissing sound, immediately shut off the main valve and evacuate the area.
* **Fire Suppression:** Only attempt to extinguish small, contained fires if a fire extinguisher is immediately available. Otherwise, prioritize evacuation.
* **Electrical Hazards:** If you smell burning insulation or see damaged wiring, immediately deactivate the main circuit breaker (fuse box).

## 3. Evacuation & Structural Mobility
* **Stairs vs. Elevators:** Under no circumstances should elevators be used. Inspect stairwells for deep structural fissures. Cross damaged sections one person at a time with extreme caution.
* **Exterior Hazards:** When exiting, stay alert for "hanging hazards"—loose masonry, bricks, or glass panes in the building's facade that may fall due to aftershocks or vibrations.

## 4. Community Solidarity (Cellular Activation)
Once your immediate safety is secured, transition to your role within the **"Neighborhood Cell"**:
* **Neighbor Assessment:** Check on adjacent units, prioritizing the elderly or those living alone. Jammed door frames are common; be prepared to assist in breaching stuck doors.
* **Field Triage:** For injuries, refer to the **[Emergency Health & First Aid](../../Civil-Safety/Emergency-Health.md)** protocol. Control severe hemorrhaging with direct pressure.
* **Information Integrity:** If the internet is down, rely on shortwave radio for verified updates. In these moments, **"Rumors are as Lethal as Shrapnel."**

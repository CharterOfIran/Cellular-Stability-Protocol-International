# ⏳ Pre-Zero-Hour Readiness Protocol

This protocol outlines essential actions to be taken during **periods of calm** (before the first siren or the onset of conflict). Preparation at this stage reduces stress by up to 80% when an actual incident occurs.

## 1. Family Communication Plan
During an emergency, family members may be scattered across home, work, or school:
* **Rendezvous Points:** Designate two meeting locations: one near your home and another outside the neighborhood (in case of local evacuation).
* **Out-of-Town Contact:** Choose a relative in a different city to act as a "Communication Bridge." During crises, long-distance calls often connect more easily than local ones.
* **Child Identification:** Place a card in children's pockets or bags containing their name, address, and emergency contact numbers.

## 2. Vital Resource Stockpiling
Priority should be given to items that become scarce within the first few hours:
* **Water:** Store at least 3 liters of water per person for 3 days. In addition to bottles, check building water tanks or other storage sources.
* **Food:** Focus on canned goods, nuts, dates, and long-life breads (e.g., traditional dry bread).
* **Energy:** Keep power banks fully charged. Owning a battery-operated radio is vital for receiving official news during internet blackouts.
* **Fuel:** If you own a vehicle, always keep the fuel tank more than half full.

## 3. The "Life Folder" (Vital Documents)
Prepare a waterproof folder containing originals or copies of:
* Birth certificates, national IDs, and passports for all members.
* Property deeds or lease agreements (to prove ownership post-crisis).
* Insurance cards and latest medical prescriptions.
* Sufficient Cash (in case of banking network and POS terminal failures).

## 4. Psychological & Educational Prep
* **30-Second Drill:** Practice with family members to ensure everyone knows exactly which safe zone in the house to reach the moment a siren sounds.
* **Child Education:** Explain sirens and bracing positions to children in simple language without causing panic. Frame it as a "Safety Game."
* **First Aid:** At least one family member should know how to apply a splint and control bleeding (refer to the **[Emergency Health](../Civil-Safety/Emergency-Health.md)** file).

## 5. Neighborhood Network (Primary Cell)
* **Skill Mapping:** Identify neighbors who are doctors, technicians, or own power generators.
* **Vulnerable Individuals:** Identify elderly or disabled neighbors so volunteers can assist them during evacuations or sheltering.

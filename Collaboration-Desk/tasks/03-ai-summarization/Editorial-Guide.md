# ✍️ Editorial & Summarization Guide

This guide outlines the process of transforming raw files from the `backlog/` into "Unique Knowledge Essence" within the project's master documents.

### Operational Synthesis Process (5-to-1 Model):
1. **Preparation:** Once 5 periodic summary versions (e.g., v1.1 to v1.5) are generated, they must be merged into the Master file.
2. **AI Utilization:** Input the content of the new files into an AI tool (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, or local LLMs) using the "Master Prompt" provided below.
3. **Output Refinement:** Review the AI output to ensure redundancies are removed and only actionable points and new ideas are merged into `Master-Summary.md`.

### 🤖 Synthesis Master Prompt:
> "The following texts consist of 5 summary reports from recent discussions. Your task is to merge all these reports into one.
> 1. Remove all repetitive ideas and suggestions, keeping only the most complete version of each.
> 2. Based on the spirit of the Charter (Protecting Innocent Lives), extract and categorize actionable points.
> 3. The output must be a single, cohesive, and non-redundant report to be used as a Master reference document."

**Requirements:** High precision in identifying redundant content and familiarity with various AI models.

# 🛠️ Technical Development Guide (Automation)

We are looking for volunteers to implement and maintain the data extraction system for this seat.

### Key Responsibilities:
1. **Automated Extraction:** Designing GitHub Actions to fetch comments and threads from GitHub Discussions.
2. **Backlog Management:** Storing raw text files in the `backlog/` directory. These files serve as the primary "Source of Truth" for the entire team.
3. **Checkpoint System:** Implementing a mechanism to prevent re-extracting previous comments, ensuring file integrity and order.
4. **Merge Packaging (Optional):** Creating a script that aggregates 5 separate backlog files into a single temporary file for the editorial team.

**Technical Requirements:** Proficiency in GitHub API, scripting (Python/Node.js), and GitHub Actions.

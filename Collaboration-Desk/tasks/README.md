# 🗂️ Task Directory (Collaboration Seats)

This folder contains specialized and general "Seats" (Tasks) designed to advance the objectives of the Charter. Each sub-folder represents a dedicated workstream focusing on a current project requirement.

### 🧭 Navigation Guide:
1.  **Requirement List:** To view the latest status of tasks, priorities, and vacant seats, always refer to the **[📋 Current Requirements List (Task-List.md)](../Task-List.md)** in the root of this section.
2.  **Seat Details:** Enter each specific task folder and read its dedicated `README.md` to understand the objectives, technical requirements, and operational steps.

### ⚖️ Core Principles:
The primary goal of all activities within this directory is the **protection of innocent lives** and facilitating a non-violent transition through collective awareness. Security, simplicity, and transparency are the non-negotiable "Red Lines" for every seat in this section.

# 🎨 Operational Design & Visualization Seat

The objective of this seat is to transform the core content of the Charter into high-impact, accessible visual designs. These infographics serve as the primary tools for public awareness and field instructions during the transition period.

## 📋 Current Operational Process:

1.  **Content Selection:** Choose critical sections from the Charter (e.g., Phase 1: First 24-Hour Protocols).
2.  **Design Standards:** Create designs based on the following criteria:
    * **Eco-Friendly/Low-Ink:** Use minimalist designs (black and white or high contrast) to ensure they can be printed cheaply and quickly.
    * **High Readability:** Use clear, large fonts suitable for reading in low-light or stressful conditions.
    * **Neutral Branding:** Avoid political symbols or individual logos; the focus must remain solely on the instructions.
3.  **⚠️ Critical Security Note:** For the safety of our contributors, **do not upload any image files to GitHub at this stage.** Keep all designs on your local, encrypted storage until the **Secure Upload Infrastructure (Task 07)** is operational.

## 🛠️ Technical Requirement (Under Development):
We have requested the Technical (Tech) Team to design a dedicated, decentralized platform for the automated security scanning and metadata scrubbing of design files. The details of this requirement are being drafted here:
* **[Secure Upload Portal (Task 07)](../07-security-upload-portal/README.md)**

As soon as this infrastructure is ready, a secure link will be provided here for the submission of your designs.

## 💡 How to Enhance This Protocol?
Security is an evolving process. If you have solutions for optimizing these visual instructions or improving delivery safety:
1.  **Guidance:** First, consult the **[Project Help Center (help)](../../../Help/README.md)**.
2.  **Submit Idea:** Follow the instructions in the Help Center to open a new **Issue**.

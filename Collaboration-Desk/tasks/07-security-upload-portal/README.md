# 🛡️ Secure Upload Portal & Audit Platform Seat (Golang & Vercel)

### 1. Mission
To create an impenetrable technical infrastructure for the secure submission of files. This portal acts as a "Digital Buffer Zone," stripping all metadata from volunteer contributions before they reach the public domain. To ensure maximum execution speed and memory safety, this infrastructure is powered by **Go (Golang)** and hosted on **Vercel**.

### 2. Technical & Operational Roadmap (Golang Optimized)
Developers in this seat should focus on the following pillars, leveraging Go's robust standard library:
* **High-Performance Scrubbing:** Utilizing Go’s efficiency to perform irreversible removal of EXIF, GPS, and device metadata from media files in milliseconds.
* **Serverless Functions (Go Runtime):** Deploying as **Vercel Serverless Functions (Go)** to ensure stateless, secure, and rapid processing without maintaining a vulnerable persistent server.
* **Security Scanning (Malware Scan):** Implementing automated file inspection to protect public safety from malicious scripts.
* **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** Ensuring data is processed in-memory (RAM) and wiped immediately after the secure hand-off, leaving zero trace on the Vercel infrastructure.

### 3. Future Integration & Vision
* **AI Summarization Gateway:** Securely connecting to AI APIs using Go's concurrent processing to automate the "5-to-1 Synthesis" of discussions.
* **Global Verified Gallery:** A high-speed, Go-powered interface for citizens to safely download instructions for local printing.

### 4. Operational Steps for Volunteers
1.  **Framework:** Focus on the **Go Runtime for Vercel**. Use lightweight packages for metadata manipulation.
2.  **Environment Security:** Strictly utilize Vercel’s encrypted environment variables for all API keys and backend secrets.
3.  **Code Transparency:** All Go source code must be Open-Source for community auditing to ensure no hidden vulnerabilities exist.

## 👥 Required Expertise:
* **Golang Developers:** Experience with Go's `net/http` and serverless deployment.
* **Vercel Specialists:** Familiar with Go runtime configurations on Vercel.
* **Security Engineers:** Experts in Zero-Log architectures and data sanitization.

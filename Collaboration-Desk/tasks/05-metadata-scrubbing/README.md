# 🧹 Metadata Scrubbing & Digital Footprint Removal Seat

### 1. Mission
The objective of this seat is to secure all Charter-related files before public release. We aim to draft simple, high-speed instructions that allow any user to remove sensitive digital footprints (GPS location, device specifications, and timestamps) from photos, videos, and documents in less than a minute.

### 2. Primary Workstreams (Roadmap)
Based on the overall project roadmap, volunteers in this section should focus on three distinct outputs:
* **Mobile Guide:** Fast methods and secure applications for Android and iOS.
* **Desktop Guide:** Utilizing Open-Source tools, preferably "portable" versions that require no installation.
* **Document Protocol:** Methods for scrubbing hidden metadata within PDF and Office files.

### 3. Operational Steps for Volunteers
To prevent redundancy and ensure quality, please follow this process:
1.  **Context Review:** Read relevant threads in the **Discussions** section to avoid duplicating existing efforts.
2.  **AI Refinement:** Before finalizing any guide, review your draft with an AI (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) to ensure the instructions are simple, effective, and easy for non-technical users to follow.
3.  **Output Submission:** Create separate instruction files within this folder and link them in the "Drafted Documents" section.

### 4. Drafted Documents (Links)
* *(No documents have been finalized yet. Links will be added here following the first contribution).*

## 👥 Required Expertise:
* Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics specialists.
* Content creators familiar with media file structures and EXIF data.

## 💡 How to Enhance This Protocol?
Security is an ongoing process. If you have solutions for optimizing these instructions:
1.  **Guidance:** First, consult the **[Project Help Center (help)](../../../Help/README.md)**.
2.  **Submit Idea:** Follow the Help Center instructions to open a new **Issue**.

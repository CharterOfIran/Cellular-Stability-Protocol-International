## 🕒 Workflow: How to Get Started

1. **[Select a Task](./Task-List.md):**
   * Visit the requirements list and choose a task that aligns with your skills.
2. **[Smart Review and Context Study](#):**
   * Before starting any activity, ensure you are updated on the latest discussions to avoid redundancy. Follow this path:
   * **Read the Summary:** Each discussion section contains a summary file reflecting the most recent decisions.
   * **AI Consultation:** For higher precision, copy the summary or the latest dialogue from the relevant section and provide it to an AI (like Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude). Review your idea with the AI first.
     * *Example Query:* "Based on these records, is my idea redundant? Which parts align with the current charter structure, and how can I refine it?"
   * **Refinement at Source:** By doing this, you evaluate and improve your idea in a private space first, then submit a polished, final version for discussion or implementation.
3. **[Propose a New Idea](#):**
   * If you have an idea outside the existing list, evaluate it with an AI first, then introduce it in the **Discussions** section.
4. **[Execution and Documentation](#):**
   * Once the path is clear, proceed with the task and document your progress according to the established protocols.

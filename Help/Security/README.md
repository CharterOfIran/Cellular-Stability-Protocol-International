# 🛡️ Security and Privacy Help Center (Security & Privacy)

This folder contains vital protocols for maintaining the digital security of volunteers and the project's technical standards for data protection. Compliance with these instructions is mandatory for any contribution to the Charter.

### 🧭 Accessing Security Documents:
* **[👤 Anonymous Contribution Guide:](./anonymous-github-setup.md)** A step-by-step guide to setting up a GitHub account and using IP-masking tools for footprint-free activity.
* **[🔐 Identity and Data Protection Protocol:](./identity-protection.md)** Outlines the project's technical Zero-Log standards and how metadata is handled.
* **[📜 Security Revision History (#)](#):** (Currently no separate history due to the stability of existing protocols).

### 🛠 How to Use:
1. **Study Before Activity:** It is highly recommended to study the "Anonymity" document thoroughly before your first contribution.
2. **Review Records:** To see the evolution of security standards, you can refer to the history section.

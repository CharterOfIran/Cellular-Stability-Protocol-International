# 👤 Guide to Creating an Anonymous GitHub Account

To ensure absolute security, if you intend to participate in the management or technical aspects of this project, you must not use your primary/personal account.

### 🛠 Steps for a Secure Account:
1. **Secure Access:** Perform all account creation and management steps exclusively through browsers based on an anonymous network (Tor) or IP-masking tools with no DNS leaks.
2. **Anonymous Email Service:** Use email services that:
   * Do not require a phone number or personal recovery email for registration.
   * Use end-to-end encryption protocols.
   * Avoid famous commercial services that share data with regulatory authorities.
3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** GitHub may require a number for verification. Instead of real/local numbers, use:
   * Authenticator Apps that work offline to generate one-time codes.
   * Virtual numbers with no link to your physical identity or SIM card.
4. **Profile Settings:**
   * Do not use your real name, personal photo, or a biography that reveals your personal catchphrases.
5. **Preventing Leaks in Commits:** After creating the account, ensure your system's Git settings are configured to hide your email in commit history.

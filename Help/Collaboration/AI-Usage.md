# 🤖 AI Usage Guide

In this Charter, we use Artificial Intelligence not as a "Decision Maker," but as a "Productivity Tool" to aggregate collective intelligence. Compliance with this protocol is mandatory to maintain the credibility of the documents.

## 🎯 Objectives of AI Usage
* **Summarization:** Transforming hundreds of scattered proposals into a single "Reference Document" (5-to-1 model).
* **Plain Language:** Converting complex technical or legal texts into simple language for the general public.
* **Technical Cleaning:** Using AI scripts to identify and strip dangerous metadata.

## ⚠️ Red Lines (Security Protocols)
1. **No Sensitive Data Sharing:** Never enter personal information, exact locations, or any data that could reveal the identity of volunteers into prompts.
2. **Human-in-the-loop:** No AI output should enter the main documents (`Infrastructure` or `Legal`) without final human editing.
3. **Transparency:** If you have written a file with the help of AI, mention it in the description (or within the Issue text).

## 🛠️ Working with Models
We use **Ready-to-Merge prompts** for working with models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini:
* Approved prompts can be found at the [Collaboration Desk](../../Collaboration-Desk/tasks/03-ai-summarization/README.md).
* Always ask the AI to provide the output in **Markdown** format for easy integration.

# 🛠️ Guide to Submitting Proposals and Issues

The **Issues** system on GitHub is the primary hub for submitting specific proposals, critiquing protocols, and reporting technical problems. Any change you wish to see in the Charter documents must first be registered here as a "Proposal."

## 🚀 How to Submit an Issue?

### 1. Prevent Redundancy
Before clicking submit, quickly browse the list of open Issues. If someone has already discussed your topic, add your comment there instead of creating a new Issue. This helps us maintain focus. (For general and open discussions, please visit the **Discussions** forum).

### 2. Steps to Register on GitHub
1. In the top navigation bar, click on **Issues**.
2. Click the green **New Issue** button.
3. Based on the topic (Protocol Revision or Technical Report), select one of the templates and click **Get Started**.
4. Write your title and description, and finally click **Submit new issue**.

## 📅 Future Plans (Summarization)
Currently, the editorial team reviews Issues manually. As contributions increase, we will soon activate the **"AI Summarization"** feature to automatically categorize and summarize long and numerous Issues, ensuring no idea is lost in the noise of discussions.

## 🏷️ Labels
The project management team may add labels to your proposal:
* `help wanted`: We need experts to help solve this.
* `under-review`: Your proposal is in the editors' queue.

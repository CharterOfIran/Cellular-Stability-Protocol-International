# 🔄 Methodology Help Center

This folder contains documents that define the "Logic of Movement," the collective refinement system, and how the protocols of this project evolve. Our goal here is to clarify the path of transforming a raw idea into an operational standard.

### 🧭 Accessing Methodology Documents:
* **[🔄 Idea Lifecycle and Approval (Idea-Lifecycle.md)](./Idea-Lifecycle.md):** Explaining the precise collaboration algorithm; from searching tasks to submitting Issues and finalizing protocols.
* **[📜 Evolution and Stabilization History (History.md)](#):** A documented report of files that have been moved to the main body of the Charter. (Currently, this section does not have a separate history due to the simplicity of current processes).

### 🛠 How to Use:
1. **Understanding the Algorithm:** It is highly recommended to study the "Idea Lifecycle" document before any serious activity at the Collaboration Desk to avoid redundant efforts.
2. **Tracking Migrations:** If you cannot find a document in the operational folders, be sure to check the "History" section to track its final destination.

> **Note:** If you have suggestions for improving the "Methodology" itself or refining the file migration process, please open an Issue for this section according to the Lifecycle instructions.

# 🔄 Idea Lifecycle and Collective Refinement

To prevent the Charter from accumulating redundant information, every contribution must follow this algorithm:

### Step 1: Search and Review
Before taking any action, first check if your topic has already been addressed:
1.  **Check Task Folders:** Browse the **[Task List](../../Collaboration-Desk/Task-List.md)**.
2.  **Match Your Idea:** * If a related task folder **exists**: Enter it. If you see a similar idea, optimize it or add your comment. If your idea is new, submit an **Issue** to request the creation of a "Sub-task" within that folder.
    * If a related task folder **does NOT exist**: Submit an **Issue** to request the creation of a new task. Write your objective clearly so that, upon approval, the folder and its `README` file can be created.

### Step 2: Rapid Contribution (Discussions)
If you only have a short comment or idea and do not want to engage with the Issue system, leave a comment in the **Discussions** section to be included in the "Intelligent Summarization" cycle.
* Go to the **Discussions** section. Each layer of the Charter (Legal, Technical, etc.) has its own specific category.
* Post your comment. These comments are automatically extracted and summarized by the project's intelligent system (AI).

### Step 3: Refinement and Approval
* Ideas in task folders are refined by experts and volunteers. 
* Once a protocol reaches sufficient maturity and passes security/legal audits, it is moved from the "Operational Tasks" to the "Final Charter Documents" and recorded in the **[History](../../Help/History.md)**.

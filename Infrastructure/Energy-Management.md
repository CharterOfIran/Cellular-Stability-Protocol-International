# 🔋 Energy and Vital Resource Management

The objective of this document is to prioritize energy consumption to sustain the neighborhood's "Main Arteries" during the first 72 hours of a transition or crisis.

## 1. Power Distribution Priorities
If using local generators or solar panels, electricity must be allocated in the following order:
1.  **Neighborhood Health Station:** For medical refrigeration and emergency lighting.
2.  **Bakeries:** To ensure the continuous production and distribution of bread.
3.  **Mesh Network Main Nodes:** To maintain the community's communication infrastructure.

## 2. Water Resource Management
* **Storage:** In the initial hours of disruption, fill residential and community water tanks immediately.
* **Equitable Distribution:** If piped water is cut, the Council must manage distribution via local wells or mobile tankers.
* **Hygiene:** Always boil water from wells or unknown sources before consumption.

## 3. Fuel and Transport
* Existing neighborhood fuel reserves (gasoline/diesel) must be rationed exclusively for **Emergency Vehicles** and **Bakery Generators**.

# 📡 Mesh Networks Communication Protocol

In the event of a global internet shutdown or mobile network disruption, this protocol enables the creation of an internal communication network for the neighborhood.

## 1. What is a Mesh Network?
In this network, every smartphone or router acts as a "Station" (Node), passing messages from one device to another without the need for cell towers or satellites.

## 2. Recommended Tools (Pre-installation Required)
We recommend installing the following apps that operate over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (off-grid):
* **Briar:** For secure, decentralized, and encrypted peer-to-peer messaging.
* **Bridgefy:** Suitable for short-range local communication and public broadcasting.
* **Meshtastic:** For advanced users utilizing LoRa radio boards for long-range communication.

## 3. Creating Local Nodes
* **Home Routers:** If electricity is available, keep Wi-Fi routers on (even without a phone line/DSL). They can act as bridges for nearby devices.
* **Elevated Points:** Volunteers in upper floors should position their devices as "Relay Bridges" to connect two different alleys or blocks.

## 4. Local Network Security
* **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do not share real names or high-risk information over open/unencrypted local networks.
* **Verified News Only:** Use these networks to relay news verified by the **[Neighborhood Council](../Civil-Safety/Neighborhood-Coordination.md)** to prevent the spread of rumors.

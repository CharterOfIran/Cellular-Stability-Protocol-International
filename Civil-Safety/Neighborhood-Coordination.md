# 🏛️ Guide to Forming a Temporary Neighborhood Council (Local Management)

During the first 72 hours of transition, the "Neighborhood" is our only safe haven. This guide outlines how to coordinate with your neighbors to prevent chaos and ensure essential services continue to function.

## 1. What is a Neighborhood Council?
A voluntary group of 5 to 9 trusted local individuals (e.g., doctors, educators, respected retirees, and responsible youth). Their primary role is to oversee the implementation of **[Sector-Specific Protocols](../Rapid-Response-72h/Sectors-Duty.md)** at the local level.

## 2. Formation Phases (Hour 1 to Hour 12)

* **Assembly Point:** Meet in a well-known public space (e.g., a school courtyard, a community center, or the lobby of a large residential complex).
* **Rapid Selection:** Avoid political complexities. Choose individuals based on **technical expertise**, **community trust**, and **leadership skills**.
* **Division of Labor:** Immediately form three small working groups:
    1.  **Logistics Group:** Coordination with local bakeries and grocery stores to ensure food security.
    2.  **Safety Group:** Organizing unarmed neighborhood watches to prevent theft and maintain peace.
    3.  **Information Group:** Distributing verified news and countering rumors via local social media or physical bulletin boards.

## 3. Immediate Tasks (Hour 12 to Hour 72)

* **Identify Vulnerable Residents:** Create a discreet list of the elderly, people with disabilities, and those with chronic illnesses who may need extra help with food or medication.
* **Communication Board:** Install a physical bulletin board at the neighborhood entrance or assembly point for vital information (e.g., nearest available doctor, bakery hours, emergency alerts).
* **Waste Management:** Organize collective efforts to prevent garbage accumulation, which is critical for preventing disease outbreaks.

## 4. The Council's Red Lines (Code of Ethics)

* **Non-Discrimination:** The council is strictly prohibited from prioritizing services (food, medicine, security) based on religion, ethnicity, or political affiliation.
* **Non-Violence:** The council has no judicial or punitive authority. Its role is management and coordination, not enforcement through force.
* **Transparency:** All decisions regarding resources or security must be communicated clearly to all neighbors.

*Unity at the neighborhood level is the foundation of national stability.*
